# graph-algorithms
This project comprises of several tasks which require designing algorithms to solve a given problem within the given time/space complexity.

- The file "graph.c" contains the solution code for tasks. Other c files and modules contain helper functions, data structures and other utilities required for smooth execution of the code.
- The file "report.pdf" contains explanations and psedocode for the algorithms designed. In addition, it contains solutions to other non-programming tasks.

This project was a part of COMP20007 - Design of Algorithms
